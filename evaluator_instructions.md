# Model Evaluation Instructions

## What You'll Be Doing

Thank you for helping with this evaluation! You'll be comparing responses from different AI models to determine which one performs better. The models are anonymized (labeled as A, B, C, and D), so you'll be making an unbiased assessment.

## Steps for Evaluation

1. **Access the evaluation platform** using the URL provided to you

2. **Create an account** or use the credentials given to you

3. **For each question**:
   - Read the question carefully
   - Review the reference answer (this is the "gold standard" response)
   - Read all four model responses
   - **Drag and reorder the responses** - place the best response at the top and the worst at the bottom
   - Click "Submit" to save your ranking

4. **Continue through all 68 questions**

5. **When finished**, let us know and we'll help you export the results

## Evaluation Criteria

When ranking responses, consider:

- **Accuracy**: How well does the response match the reference answer?
- **Completeness**: Does it cover all important aspects of the question?
- **Coherence**: Is the response well-structured and easy to understand?
- **Relevance**: Does it directly address the question asked?

## Tips

- Take breaks if needed - your progress will be saved
- Focus on the content of the responses, not their formatting
- If you're unsure about a ranking, go with your best judgment
